summary: On-going research for part one of my PhD research, in collaboration with RLSS UK, RLNI & Kings College London. As you’re aware, swimming pool facilities, water parks, and beached areas are places where individuals of all ages can learn how to swim, practise sports and socialize. Whilst the joy individuals experience through swimming is seemingly shared by millions worldwide the associated risk and severity of drowning is often overlooked; particularly, when drowning if left unnoticed can lead to life changing injuries or even death. Here’s where the role of a lifeguard becomes so important and why we all agree that research in this area has substantial benefits to bathers. So, what makes our experienced lifeguards such experts at protecting our bathers? We can train our lifeguards to spot, respond and provide rescue when someone falls into difficulty both inside and out of the water; however, as we know, this is by no means all we expect from our lifeguards. But, how do we ensure all lifeguards are best equipped to deal with this multidisciplinary role of a certified life saver? 
Here’s where we need you, the reader, previous and current lifeguards, to help us answer these important questions. Excitingly, the Royal Life Saving Society has begun to explore what makes a lifeguard so good at spotting potential hazards, accidents and drown scenarios unfolding. This exciting project, in collaboration with the Royal National Lifeboat Institute, the University of Chichester and Kings College London, will be assessing the psychological differences between lifeguards of varying experience with the aim to gain a deeper understanding into what makes a lifeguard tick and use this information to ultimately improve the performance of lifeguards further. 
Excitingly, this area of research will be the first to do so amongst lifeguards and by taking part you will be helping us play a significant part in improving the lifeguards of today and tomorrow. Here’s how to get involved: ensure you read our information sheet, including all the important details regarding this unique study (https://docdro.id/E6rrGdQ); once you’ve read the document and understand what is involved in the study, follow the link to begin (https://lifeguard.cognitron.co.uk). For those that take part, or consider taking part, in our study, we just wanted to extend our upmost appreciation and thank you for helping make our watered areas safer for us all.
