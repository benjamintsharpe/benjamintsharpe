My PhD focusses on developing a greater understanding of psychological factors and neurocognitive processes involved in drown detection among lifeguards. A working title is: 'An investigation into the attributes that underpin lifeguard experience and drown detection performance.' Drowning is a global concern, with conservative estimates identifying a death rate of over 320,000 victims per year (World Health Organization, 2019). It is therefore surprising that previous research exploring the role, training and performance of a lifeguard is somewhat limited. What we do know from the literature is that experienced lifeguards are 4.9 times more likely to detect a drowning victim than less experienced individuals (Page et al., 2011). However, what is unclear is a coherent explanation of this occurrence. The thesis will attempt to address this gap in knowledge. It is the overall aim of this thesis to share key findings via peer review publications, conference presentations, and media engagements to help to prevent lives being lost from drowning.
