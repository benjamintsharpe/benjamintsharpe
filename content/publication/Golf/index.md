abstract: An extensive body of research exists which has investigated ‘Quiet Eye’ and performance in aiming tasks. However, little attention has been paid to whether the context in which tasks are executed affects Quiet Eye and, despite consistent behavioural effects, little is known about the mechanisms that underpin the phenomenon. In this study, 21 novice participants completed golf putts in three different contexts while pupil dilation, Quiet Eye duration, and putting accuracy were measured. Results showed putting was more accurate when putting to win compared to the control (no context) condition and Quiet Eye duration was longer when putting to win or tie a hole compared to the control condition. There was no effect of context on pupil dilation. Results suggest that, while the task was challenging, performance scenarios can be included in learning environments for novice golfers to enhance representativeness of practice without adding additional load to cognitive resources.

# summary: A mobile visual clothing search system is presented whereby a smart phone
#  user can either choose a social networking image or capture a new photo of a person
#  wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a large cloud-based
#  ecommerce database. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail
#  store location, to inform the user of local stores where similar clothing items
#  can be tried on.
