My current research interests focus on mechanisms (e.g., visual, cognitive) that may systematically discriminate individuals with varying degrees of experience, performance capabilities and levels of expertise. My PhD focusses on developing a greater understanding of the factors and processes that are involved in facilitating superior drown detection performance among lifeguards. Iâ€™m interested in collaborating in any research that aligns with my interests. Contact me at [b.sharpe@chi.ac.uk](b.sharpe@chi.ac.uk).
